# fpv_robot_full
# 
#Full version of my three months coders.bay graduation project, a point of view robot.
#
#A ESP8266 microconbtroller acts as the socket server which controlls the hardware (4 motors and a servo) and makes controlling #possible via a client or directly over a http page the server hosts in the network. 
#
#Micropython code: boot.py and main.py
#
#A ESP32-cam module hosts live video in the network and a servo (controlled from the ESP8266) tilts the cam left, middle and right.
#
#Arduino code: webcamserver.ino
#
#
#GUI.java, Main.java and OpernWebcam.java are the Java files of my control application.
#control_software_v1.3.jar is the fully compiled software.
